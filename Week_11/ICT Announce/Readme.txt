The app uses the MWFeedParser library to read and display an RSS feed.
https://github.com/mwaterfall/MWFeedParser

The RSS feed is the School of ICT 'announcements'.

This app is based on the recently-used 'ClassesV2' template.

~~~~~

Notice the "ICT Announce-Bridging-Header.h" source code file.
It is needed when we use Objective-C code in our project.
It includes Objective-C "#import" statements for the source code 'header' files that we are using in our Swift code.
